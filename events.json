    "extendedDescription": "I took one of my most anticipated trips and visited Athens, the city of the ancient gods, before exploring the island of Aegina. \n\n Greece received me better than I was expecting, with sunny weather, 26°C beaches, and countless breathtaking ruins. I fell in love with the history, the people and (of course) the amazing Freddo Espresso coffee. \n\n Later on the trip I spent a few days on Aegina and even got the chance to visit Moni Island. Incredible food, stunning views, and the crystal-clear waters of those seas made it unforgettable.",

Between the snowy hikes, hot springs in Chochołowskie Termy, and speeding around on a snowmobile, I fell completely in love with Polish winters.",
