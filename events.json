    "extendedDescription": "I went to Poland this winter to surprise a friend and ended up having one of the best trips ever. Gdańsk welcomed me with snow, Christmas lights, and the smell of hot wine. I spent my days ice skating, exploring the markets, and trying every local food I could find.\n\nAfter that, I headed to Kraków, visited Auschwitz, wandered through the old streets, and took a trip to the mountains in Zakopane. Between the snowy hikes, hot springs in Chochołowskie Termy, and speeding around on a snowmobile, I fell completely in love with Polish winters.",

Looking back, it was a time of growth, discovery, and some of the best memories I’ve got.",
