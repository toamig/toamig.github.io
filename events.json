      "This trip was completely different from anything I had ever experienced. It was my first stepping outside of Europe, the first time using my passport, and the first time preparing for a trip with a travelers' medical consultation. I received valuable guidance about local health precautions and ended up taking four vaccines before flying out.",
      "Arriving in Senegal was a cultural and emotional shock. The heat hit me immediately, and I quickly noticed how underdeveloped many areas were... unfinished buildings, visible poverty, and chaotic traffic. Yet, among all that, there were countless happy kids playing outside, full of energy and joy.",
      "I stayed at the Rio Baobab resort, which ended up feeling like a spiritual retreat. The beach water was always warm, around 30°C, the nights were filled with themed activities. Local food options were limited, mostly fish-based dishes, and the incredible baobab juice.",
      "The experiences I had were unforgettable. I went on a safari and saw rhinos, giraffes, zebras, and crocodiles roaming their natural habitat. Later, I joined an experience focused only on lions, where we stayed inside a reinforced vehicle while these majestic felines approached us closely. It was surreal!.",
      "I also visited Gorée Island, a historically heavy place marked by Portuguese, Dutch, French, and English presence during the era of slavery. The visit to the iconic House of Slaves — now a museum — was powerful and emotional.",
      "Another highlight was the Monument of the African Renaissance, a 49-meter-tall bronze structure that dominates the landscape. It's majestic, controversial among locals, and absolutely worth seeing up close.",
      "Despite being so different from what I'm used to, the trip was incredible. I would absolutely do it again, especially now that I understand the local culture better, including how to negotiate with Senegalese street sellers, who really push hard!"

I read extensively on the subject, including a full book dedicated to procedural generation in games, and became fascinated by the balance between randomness, control, and design intent.",

The goal was to design a system capable of generating levels based on a target difficulty input, automatically testing them with simulated waves of enemies to evaluate how well the generated level matched the intended challenge.",
      "This milestone marked the completion of the state of the art and the formal delivery of my monography.

      "After Madrid, I remembered I had a friend working in Valencia and, unlike Barcelona, the forecast there was sunny. So, I drove south to meet him and enjoy the rest of my trip. We met an adventurous group of people who stayed with us all night to watch the sunrise and dive into the sea after a sleepless night.",
      "On the last day, we headed to Benidorm to experience its lively beach lifestyle. Needless to say, I tried authentic paella, and it was as awesome as it could be.",
      "In the end, I drove the 9 hours straight back to Portugal to reach the office in time for work. It was such a unique and unforgettable experience."
