      "As a child, I was always energetic and loved balancing indoor and outdoor activities, so I wanted to bring back that balance to my life.",
      "I bought the cheapest skates I could find and a set of protective gear, and started practicing on my own. It gave me that feeling I was craving: learning something new, experimenting through trial and error, and feeling progress with every session.",
      "After just a few months, it started to feel natural. I could move freely, brake, jump, perform manuals, and confidently tackle pipes and pools in a more aggressive style."

      "During this phase of my Master's, I faced an unexpected challenge: none of the proposed thesis topics matched my interests or long-term goals. I knew I wanted to work on something related to games, so I decided to pursue a custom topic that would truly motivate me.",
      "After many conversations with professors and former students, I began researching the state of the art in procedural generation, exploring its applications and potential in the gaming field. I read extensively on the subject, including a full book dedicated to procedural generation in games, and became fascinated by the balance between randomness, control, and design intent.",
      "Eventually, I defined my thesis around the generation and assessment of tower defense maps with controlled difficulty. The goal was to design a system capable of generating levels based on a target difficulty input, automatically testing them with simulated waves of enemies to evaluate how well the generated level matched the intended challenge.",
      "This milestone marked the completion of the state of the art and the formal delivery of my monography. It laid the foundation for the research and development phase that would later follow, and it was the first real step into combining my academic background with my passion for game development."

      "Because the project was being shipped on multiple platforms, including PlayStation and Xbox, I also had the chance to work closely with console-specific builds and requirements. It gave me first-hand insight into the final stages of the production pipeline, from QA feedback to the submission process and release preparation.",
      "Despite joining late in development, it was incredibly rewarding to see the game go live and know that I had contributed to its final shape. It was a defining moment that deepened my understanding of large-scale production and multiplayer systems."

      "And so it happened... I joined as a junior developer, completely unfamiliar with the technologies and processes being used. But I learned fast, asked countless questions, and paid close attention to every detail. It felt like there was valuable knowledge everywhere. I often stayed late at the office with the last programmers, then went home to study more Unreal Engine to show my leads I was growing.",
      "The effort definitely paid off. Over time, I earned more independence and the trust of my leads and managers. I was definitely on the right track.",
      "It's also important to say that beyond the career growth, Saber gave me friendships that I'm sure will last a lifetime. Between late work nights, intense milestone deliveries, and fun cultural events, the memories I brought with me remain very vivid."
